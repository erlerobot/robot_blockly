`robot_blockly` is a ROS package that provides web-based visualization and block programming tools for robots and drones.

*Note: The package has been renamed from ros_rosimple to robot_blockly to meet http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Patterns/Conventions*

### Installation:

Pre-requisites:

```
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install rosdep rosinstall_generator wstool rosinstall
sudo pip install autobahn trollius
```

Then create a new workspace:
```
mkdir -p blockly/src
cd blockly/src
wstool init

If you have added an ssh key for your machine to your github account, use:
wstool set robot_blockly --git git@github.com:shadow-robot/robot_blockly

Otherwise run:
wstool set robot_blockly --git https://github.com/shadow-robot/robot_blockly.git

wstool up
```

To build the workspace:
```
cd ../
catkin_make
```

To start the backend and built-in HTTP server:
```
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch robot_blockly robot_blockly.launch 
```

In order to include a blocks library for additional blocks (e.g. [sr_blockly](https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr_blockly)), clone the repository into your workspace and run:
```
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch robot_blockly robot_blockly.launch block_packages:=[sr_blockly_blocks]
```

### Create your own blocks
- Default blockly blocks are stored in the blockly repository which is cloned as a Git submodule.
- Shadow's blocks package can be found [here](https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr_blockly)
- If you want to create your own blocks, you can either add them to an existing ROS package or create a new package.
- Blocks can be generated by opening [http://localhost:8000/blockly/demos/blockfactory/index.html](http://localhost:8000/blockly/demos/blockfactory/index.html)
- Design you own block and then add the metadata to: `blocks` and `generators` in the block repository. An xml snippet should be included in any Javascript file of the block repository, please see [sr_blockly](https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr_blockly/tree/master/sr_blockly_blocks/toolbox) for an example of how to do this.
- catkin_make will automatically merge all Javascript files into a single file. So in case if you have changed Javascript file you need to run catkin_make.

### Advanced

#### Saving functions
Functions can be created with the standard in-built function blocks. If you wish to save a function as a new block, select 'Save Function' from the Builder menu. 
You may select in which category you wish to save the new block, this can be a new category that is specified by appending '/' and the name of the new category to the existing category name, for example:

Select existing category: Variables\
Or to place block in a new category: Variables/new_category_name

The 'Function' dropdown allows you to select the function that you wish to save.
Once 'Save' has been selected, a Javascript file will be downloaded. This file should be added to your block repository toolbox directory where the existing category Javascript files reside.
catkin_make should then be run to rebuild blocks_uncompressed.js.

#### Dynamic data loading from server
Sometimes it is convenient to load data from the server for a component.
In order to implement server side processing web service modules were introduced.
You need to create the file **web_service_module.py** in your library package and put in there the class **WebServiceModule**.
This class can have functions which accept a parameter object and return a result object.

API **Blockly.callWebService** provides the possibility to call such methods by name and pass a parameter from Javascript.

Also **Blockly.waitForComponentToLoad** allows you to call such web modules and wait for it's execution before loading workspace.
It can be used to configure blocks depending on the server data.
An example can be found [here](https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr_blockly/blob/master/sr_blockly_blocks/blocks/trajectory_named_waypoint.js).
