### Installation:

Pre-requisites:

```
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install rosdep rosinstall_generator wstool rosinstall
sudo pip install autobahn trollius
```

Then create a new workspace:
```
mkdir -p blockly/src
cd blockly/src
wstool init

If you have added an ssh key for your machine to your github account, use:
wstool set robot_blockly --git git@github.com:shadow-robot/robot_blockly

Otherwise run:
wstool set robot_blockly --git https://github.com/shadow-robot/robot_blockly.git

wstool up
```

To build the workspace:
```
cd ../
catkin_make
```

To start the backend and built-in HTTP server:
```
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch robot_blockly robot_blockly.launch 
```

In order to include a blocks library for additional blocks (e.g. [sr_blockly](https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr_blockly)), clone the repository into your workspace and run:
```
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch robot_blockly robot_blockly.launch block_packages:=[sr_blockly_blocks]
```

### Create your own blocks
- Default blockly blocks are stored in the blockly repository which is cloned as a Git submodule.
- Shadow's blocks package can be found [here](https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr_blockly)
- If you want to create your own blocks, you can either add them to an existing ROS package or create a new package.
- Blocks can be generated by opening [http://localhost:8000/blockly/demos/blockfactory/index.html](http://localhost:8000/blockly/demos/blockfactory/index.html)
- Design you own block and then add the metadata to: `blocks` and `generators` in the block repository. An xml snippet should be included in any Javascript file of the block repository, please see [sr_blockly](https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr_blockly/toolbox) for an example of how to do this.
- catkin_make will automatically merge all Javascript files into a single file. So in case if you have changed Javascript file you need to run catkin_make.
