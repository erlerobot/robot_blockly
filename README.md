### Installation:

Pre-requisites:

```
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install rosdep rosinstall_generator wstool rosinstall
sudo pip install autobahn trollius
```

Then create a new workspace:
```
mkdir -p blockly/src
cd blockly/src
wstool init

If you have added an ssh key for your machine to your github account, use:
wstool set robot_blockly --git git@github.com:shadow-robot/robot_blockly

Otherwise run:
wstool set robot_blockly --git https://github.com/shadow-robot/robot_blockly.git

wstool up
```

To build the workspace (or rebuild it - you can do this while the robot_blockly_backend node is running!):
```
cd ../
catkin_make_isolated --pkg robot_blockly --install
```

To start the backend and build in HTTP server:
```
source install_isolated/setup.bash 
roslaunch robot_blockly robot_blockly.launch 
```

- Launch `python build.py` to regenerate the blocks.
