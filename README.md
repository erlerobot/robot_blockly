### Installation:

Pre-requisites:

```
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install rosdep rosinstall_generator wstool rosinstall
sudo pip install autobahn trollius
```

Then create a new workspace:
```
mkdir -p blockly/src
cd blockly/src
wstool init

If you have added an ssh key for your machine to your github account, use:
wstool set robot_blockly --git git@github.com:shadow-robot/robot_blockly

Otherwise run:
wstool set robot_blockly --git https://github.com/shadow-robot/robot_blockly.git

wstool up
```

To build the workspace (or rebuild it - you can do this while the robot_blockly_backend node is running!):
```
cd ../
catkin_make_isolated --pkg robot_blockly --install
```

To start the backend and build in HTTP server:
```
source install_isolated/setup.bash 
roslaunch robot_blockly robot_blockly.launch 
```

### Create your own blocks
- Default blockly blocks are stored in the blockly package. If you require additional block repositories for your project, these repositories should be cloned into your workspace at the same level as robot_blockly. Then rebuild your workspace.
- If you want to create your own blocks, you can either add them to an existing ros package or create a new package.
- Blocks can be generated by opening [http://localhost:8000/blockly/demos/blockfactory/index.html](http://localhost:8000/blockly/demos/blockfactory/index.html)
- Design you own block and then add the metadata to: `blocks` and `generators` in the block repository. An xml snippet should be included in a file called blockly.txt in the highest level of the block repository, please see [sr_blockly_blocks](https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr_blockly_blocks) for an example of how to do this.
- Make sure blockly backend has been launched and run `python build.py` in the scripts directory to regenerate the blocks.
